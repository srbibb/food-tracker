# food-tracker
This is an application to keep track of what food a user has, and when given a list of ingredients needed can create a shopping list containing any items which are not currently in the stock of food the user has.

The user is currently able to add and remove items to the pantry recorded by the application, which is written to a file so it can be saved between uses. The user can also view this list to check what is listed as available. The user can also give the application a list of ingredients that the user needs, and the application will provide a list containing the items which are needed but not in the list of items, meaning the user needs to buy these items.

The next aim of the project is to add a list of "essential items" which will always be added to the shopping list if they are missing from the current pantry list, regardless of whether they are on the list of needed items the user provides.
